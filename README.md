# Exercise 01

The file `ex1.py` contains a template for a function. It's your task to write code in the body of the function, such that it returns the correct values.

The function receives one argument, which is an integer value. The function *returns* a string that is as long as the supplied argument. For instance, if the argument value is 3, the returned string should be 3 characters long. If the argument value is 0, the returned string should be an empty one. The content of the returned string does not matter. 

If the argument value is below zero, the function should raise an exception (this can be of type `Exception`).
